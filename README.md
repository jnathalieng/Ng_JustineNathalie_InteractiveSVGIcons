## Interactive SVG Icons
This project includes a custom set of 6 branded, scalable SVG icons designed in Adobe Illustrator. Each icon represents a different character flavor and is used as part of a product showcase on my FIP for Squeezit Brand. Each icon is animated with simple CSS transitions and logs a message to the browser console when clicked.

Characters 
Strawnana – a strawberry-banana flavored character
Grippy Gloop – grape flavor with a gooey personality
Tiki Tango – tropical pineapple mango combo
Sunny Peel – bright and citrusy orange
Mysti Swirl – four-seasons flavor with a magical swirl
Apple Dabble – sweet and classic apple design
